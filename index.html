            <br>
            <p><b>Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, of which the region was a part of until 1948.[3] As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.
                For a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under the control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Bombay State. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960. Osmanabad has a historical lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada, and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.
                Osmanabad was officially renamed as Dharashiv on February 2023.[2] The name derives from the Dharashiv Caves.</b>

                <h2>Yedshi Ramling Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
                <br>
                <p><b>Yedshi Ramling Wildlife Sanctuary is found in the villages of Yedshi, Wadgaon and Bhanasgaon near Osmanabad City in the Balaghat range. Yedshi is regarded to be the Matheran forest of the Osmanabad district. Yedshi is considered as a possible hill station-cum-health resort. It is a railway station on the Miraj-Latur broad gauge railway.
                    One object of interest nearby is the temple of Ramling. Situated about two miles from Yedshi, Ramling was a railway station on the Miraej-Latur narrow gauge section of the South-Central Railway. The temple is located in a ravine so deep that the temple's spire cannot be seen from a distance and even after reaching the temple entrance gate. To reach the temple one descends a number of steps. The temple has an open courtyard with a sabhamandap and a pindi of Shankar placed in an inner chamber. Many devotees flock to the temple every Monday in the month of Shravana. An annual fair is held in honour of Shri Ramling on Margashirsha Shuddha 4th and 5th (Novemberâ€“December). More than five thousand people assemble here at the time of the fair. The temple of Ramling is also a shrine of Jatayu.
                    The place is also revered, considered to be the spot where Jatayu attacked Ravana, the king of Lanka, while he was carrying away Sita by force. Jatayu lost the battle and died at the hands of Ravana.
                    Dry deciduous forests occupy the area. Wildlife species include chinkara, hyena, wolf, wild bear, fox, blackbuck, hares and seacock. Over 100 species of birds are also found. The best time[original research?] to visit is from October to June
